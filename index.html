            <h1>Hi, I'm Scott ðŸ‘‹</h1>
            <p>I've been building things for the web since the early 2000s. I'm the founder & CEO of
                <a href="https://tina.io">Tina.io</a>, an open-source CMS. I also
                volunteer to teach web development to refugees in Prince Edward Island, where I live with my wife and
                two daughters.
            </p>
            <p>This blog is where I write about things I'd like to share with the world.</p>
