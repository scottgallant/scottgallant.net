            <p><small>View of Hog Island off of Prince Edward Island, Canada</a></small></p>
            <p>I live on an island in the
                Atlantic ocean with my wife and two daughters üá®üá¶. I'm the founder & CEO
                of
                <a href="https://tina.io">Tina.io</a>, an open-source Content Management System. I'm also a volunteer coding
                instructor, a bread baker, and I love playing outside whenever I can. This is my corner of the web where I write things.
            </p>
            <h2>Values</h2>
            <p>Here are a list of my values. I'm deliberately not including things here that most people
                aspire to, like "integrity". These are more like characteristics that I
                appreciate.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Curiosity</li>
                <li>Resourcefulness</li>
                <li>Creativity</li>
                <li>Play</li>
                <li>Skepticism</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Quotes</h2>
            <p>I love quotes. They can provide clarity to parts of life that might seem blurry.</p>
            <p>My highschool year book quote was
            <blockquote>"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take"</blockquote>
            </p>
            <p> 20-some years later, my friends still
                poke fun
                at me for that cheesy quote. But I have no regrets :) </p>

            <p>Here are
                some of my favorites Quotes</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Every saint has past and every sinner has a future</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>‚ÄúWe act as though comfort and luxury were the chief requirements of life. All that we
                        need to
                        make us happy is something to be enthusiastic about.‚Äù
                        ‚Äï Albert Einstein</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>"If you want to build a ship, don‚Äôt drum up the men and women to gather wood, divide the
                        work,
                        and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea." ‚Äï <a
