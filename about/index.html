            <p>Hi. I'm Scott. I've been building things for the web since the early 2000s. I'm the founder & CEO of
                <a href="https://tina.io">Tina.io</a>, an open-source Content Management System. I'm a volunteer coding
                instructor, I like
                to bake bread, and I play outside as much as possible. I live on an island in the
                Atlantic ocean üá®üá¶ with my wife and two daughters.
            </p>
            <h2>Values</h2>
            <p>I've been thinking about qualities and characteristics that I value. Some of these aren't concious,
                they're more patterns that I observe in my life. These are deliberately not values that most people
                aspire to, like "integrity", they're more characteristics that I subscribe to that make me unique.</p>
            <p><strong>Discovery/curiosity/exploration</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Resourceful</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Creativity</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Play</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Skepticism</strong></p>
            <h2>Quotes</h2>
            <p>My highschool year book quote was
            <blockquote>"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take"</blockquote> And it wasn't intended to be sarcastic
            or tongue in cheek. My friends still make fun
            of me for having such a cheesy quote. But recently, I've come to appreciate that side of myself. The side
            who
            tries hard to find
            meaning in life. </p>

            <p>I love quotes. They can provide clarity to things in life that otherwise might seem blurry. Here are
                some of my favorites</p>
            <p>
            <blockquote>Every saint has past and every sinner has a future</blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
            <blockquote>‚ÄúWe act as though comfort and luxury were the chief requirements of life. All that we need to
                make us happy is something to be enthusiastic about.‚Äù
                ‚Äï Albert Einstein</blockquote>
