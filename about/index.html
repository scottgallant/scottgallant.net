            <p>Hi. I'm Scott. I've been building things for the web since the early 2000s. I'm the founder & CEO of
                <a href="https://tina.io">Tina.io</a>, an open-source Content Management System. I'm a volunteer coding
                instructor, I like
                to bake bread, and I play outside as much as possible. I live on an island in the
                Atlantic ocean with my wife and two daughters.
            </p>
            <h2>Values</h2>
            <p>I'm deliberately not including things here that I (and
                most people)
                aspire to, like "integrity". These are more like characteristics that I observe in myself and
                appreciate. I intend to
                elaborate on these eventually.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Curiosity</li>
                <li>Resourcefulness</li>
                <li>Creativity</li>
                <li>Play</li>
                <li>Skepticism</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Quotes</h2>
            <p>I love quotes. They can provide clarity to parts of life that might seem blurry.</p>
            <p>My highschool year book quote was
            <blockquote>"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take"</blockquote>
            </p>
            <p> 20-some years later, my friends still
                poke fun
                at me for that cheesy quote. But I have no regrets :) </p>

            <p>Here are
                some of my favorites Quotes</p>
            <p>
            <blockquote>Every saint has past and every sinner has a future</blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
            <blockquote>“We act as though comfort and luxury were the chief requirements of life. All that we need to
                make us happy is something to be enthusiastic about.”
                ― Albert Einstein</blockquote>
