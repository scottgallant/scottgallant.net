            <p id="toc_0" class="call-out"><strong>Draft -</strong> This post is a work-in-progress.</p>

            <p>My wife's friend died recently and we just attended her funeral. I was struck by her rich circle of friends and family.

                She was close to many loving, wonderful people.

                She died from a sudden heart attack but not long before her death she told a friend that was happier than ever.</p>

            <p>She lived a good life.</p>

            <p>I've been kind of obsessed with figuring out a recipe for a good life lately. Maybe that's
                becaue I turned 40 recently and all of a sudden time feels finite, so I want to make the best of it. </p>

            <p>I haven't been looking at this question from a mindset or values perspective. I'm not thinking about things like accepting yourself or
                appreciating what you have. Instead, I'm asking "how should I spend my time?". </p>
            <p>Evereyone's different but here's my recipe so far:</p>

            <h2>Connecting with others</h2>
            Connecting with friends and family is key to living a good life. This could be:
            <ul>
                <li>Dinner with your family</li>
                <li>Playing a game with friends</li>
                <li>Having a deep conversation with a loved one</li>
            </ul>

            Spend quality time with people you love. The more, the better. </p>

            <h2>Playing</h2>

            You're playing when you do fun things that you enjoy. Think of things like:

            <ul>
                <li>Skiing</li>
                <li>Reading a good book</li>
                <li>Hiking</li>
                <li>Dancing with friends (bonus points for <em>connecting with others</em>)</li>
                <li>Playing guitar</li>
                <li>Gardening</li>
                <li>Playing sports</li>
                <li>Playing video games</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Any leisure activity is play.</p>
            <p>As we get older we get serious and too busy to play. But it's what makes life interesting. </p>

            <h2>Working</h2>

            <p>Do good work that you're proud of. Big bonus points if your work is meaningful to you.</p>
            <p>Work isn't always paid. For example, if you're helping a friend build a deck, you're working. A life with a lot of work is a good life.
                We feel better when we're productive.
                The point is to care about your work and be proud of whatever you accomplish. </p>

            <h2>Personal Growth</h2>
            <p>When we're working toward a goal and improving ourselves, we feel good.</p>
            <p>Life is good when we're working on ourselves.</p>
            <p>This could mean learning at school, practicing a skill, training for a competition.</p>


            <h2>Helping Others</h2>
            <p>Truly helping others is the highest level of being.</p>
            <p>If your friend finds themself in the hospital and needs you to do walk their dog.</p>
            <p>For me this is means teaching coding to youngsters. </p>

            <h2>Staying Healthy</h2>

            <p>Everything is better when your mind and body are healthy. When that's not the case, we suffer. It takes a lot of time and hard work to
                maintain good
                health, but it's essential.</p>
            <!--
            <h2>Notes</h2>

            <p>This is doesn't take into account those who are affected by trauma, illness, addictions, challening relationships, war, and so on. </p>

            <p>this doesn't include rest, personal time, taking care of your affairs, mowing your lawn, paying taxes, etc.</p>

            <p>These things come at a cost. You can't do everything. You have to choose and you need rest and down time. </p>

            <p>don't be wasteful. Don't cause harm to others. be respectful.</p>
            <p>accept yourself. Accept things as they are.</p>
            <p>my thinking is so not budhhist</p>
