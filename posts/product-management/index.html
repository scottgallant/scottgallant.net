        <p>
          If your product is weak, everything gets harder and the company is at
          risk of failing. If your product is the best, everything gets easier
          and it becomes a force multiplier on success. Product management is a
          difficult and often misunderstood role. This article distills what I
          consider to be the core principles of the product management role.

        <h2>When is a Product Manager Successful?</h2>

          A Product Manager (PM) is successful when

        <h2>Product Manager Success Metrics</h2>

        An increase in the these metrics indicate that the PM is doing a good
        job:
        <ul>
          <li>User adoption</li>
          <li>Business impact (i.e. revenue)</li>
          <li>Customer satisfaction</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Attributes of a Good Product Manager</h2>
        <p>
          The best PMs push through when faced with adverse conditions instead
          of blaming their circumstances. They also show the following
          characteristics:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Immense user empathy</li>
          <li>Deep care/obsession</li>
          <li>Low ego</li>
          <li>Ownership Mindset</li>
          <li>Influential communication</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Product Manager Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>
          Before we dive into what a PM does, it helps to understand how the
          responsibilities are divided up between each role on the team. I like
          Marty Cagan's framework where each person is responsible for a
          different product "risk".
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th style="width: 60%">Product Risk</th>
            <th>Person Responsible</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Valuable </strong> - do users want it?</td>
            <td>Product Manager</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Feasible</strong> - can we do it?</td>
            <td>Engineers</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Usable</strong> - can users figure it out?</td>
            <td>Designer</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <strong>Viable</strong> - does it make sense for the business?
            </td>
            <td>Product Manager</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          A PM is responsible for ensuring a product is valuable (do users want
          it) and viable (does it make sense for the business). Here's how they
          go about that.
        </p>
        <h2>What Does a Product Manager Do?</h2>
        <h3>1. Research</h3>
        <p>PMs need expert-level knowledge in the following areas:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 0">
          <li>The product</li>
          <li>The users</li>
          <li>The data</li>
          <li>The competitive landscape</li>
          <li>Intricacies of the business</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <br />The last bullet refers to how the product is marketed, sold,
          compliance issues, security issues, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          A PM must become a world expert in these areas and that requires a lot
          of time and an ongoing effort. It needs to be a key priority in the
          daily life of a PM. When this is done well, the PM brings key
          knowledge to the product team that allows everyone to make better
          decisions.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Prioritization</h3>

        <p>
          Equiped with expert-level knowledge from their research, the PM's job
          is to get their team aligned on what to work on. This prioritization
          is a collaboration with engineering, design, and stakeholders, but the
          PM ultimately makes the final call.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prioritization should be informed by the PM's research. However, it
          also needs to be guided by a strong product vision and understanding
          of what will deliver real value.
        </p>
        <p>
          To get the most out of your team, focus on prioritizing problems
          instead of solutions or features. For example:
        </p>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th style="width: 50%">ðŸš«<br />Solution-focused</th>
            <th>âœ… <br />Problem-focused</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Add a social sharing button</td>
            <td>Help users easily share content with their friends</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
          Focusing on a user need or problem allows the engineers and designers
          to flex their creative muscles and find the best solution. To empower
          the team even more, prioritize measurable business
          <strong>outcomes</strong> instead of problems. Like so:
        </p>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th style="width: 50%">âœ… <br />Problem-focused</th>
            <th>âœ… âœ… âœ… <br />Outcome-focused</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Help users easily share content with their friends</td>
            <td>Increase user-engagemnet by 10%</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          Getting the team aligned is often difficult and requires good
          communication skills:
        </p>

        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
          <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
            A senior product managerâ€™s singular value lies in galvanizing action
            around things that are<br /><br />A) Not obvious but correct, or<br /><br />B)
            Obvious but big &amp; scary<br /><br />We tend romanticize A and it
            is indeed important, but in the real world, most products &amp;
            teams simply need a lot more of B.

        ></script>

        <h3>3. Solution Discovery</h3>

        <p>
          PM's don't just walk away after handing off a prioritized list of
          problems to solve or outcomes to achieve. A good product manager is a
          creator that works closely with the team throughout the entire
          process. This includes driving the solution discovery process where
          the team discovers the best solution to solve their user's problem or
          achieve their business outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the real world is complicated and solutions need to be tested to
          learn if they really work. If not, they need to evolve. This is where
          the magic happens, according to Steve Jobs in
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRZAJY23xio"
            >The Lost Interview</a
          >:

          There's a tremendous amount of craftsmanship in between a great idea
          and a finished product...It never comes out like it starts.
        </blockquote>
        <p>A PM leads this discovery process by doing things like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Customer interviews</li>
          <li>Prototyping</li>
          <li>Usability testing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Tom Chi does an incredible job of describing just how quickly a team
          can test and iterate their ideas in his talk - Rapid Prototyping (jump
          to 7:56):
        </p>

        <div class="videowrapper">
          <iframe
            width="560"
            height="315"
            src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wINoHEXJ2-M?si=z6xecOMkuYUHsKLV&amp;start=476"

            allowfullscreen
          ></iframe>
        </div>

        <h3>4. Quality</h3>
        <p>
          Finally, after all the discovery has been done, the learnings have
          been uncovered, the engineers and designers go off and deliver their
          solution. When they finished building and testing it, the PM is the
          last line of defense before it goes live. If something is not right,
          the PM is responsible for catching it and works with the team to
          correct it.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Ultimately, the foundation of a successful company lies in its
          product, and the product manager is the linchpin of that success.
          Setting that person up for success is essential for the future of the
          business.
