            <p><small>Does your product suck? Maybe it just needs more features üòâ </a></small></p>
            <p>The product management role is the most important role in a (product) company. If your product sucks, everything gets harder and the company is at risk of failing. If your product is the best, everything gets easier and it's like a force multiplier on success. <strong>An excellent product is the foundation of a successfull company and this all hinges on the product manager.</strong></p>
                
<p>There is a lot of advice out there on this topic. I've summarized my favorite learnings about the product management role in this article.</p>
            


            <h2>What is Product Management?</h2>
<p>My two favorite definitions:</p>

  <blockquote><p>Product management is the art, science, and practice of making successful products (or making existing products successful).<small><sup><a href="https://x.com/shreyas/status/1633854780648083456?lang=en" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup></small><br /><small> - Shreyas Doshi - Former Stripe, Twitter, Google, Yahoo</small></p>
</blockquote> 
  <blockquote> <p>Product management is making good decisions about what to build, when.<small><sup><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7nHWImHkeORQR5jCqSeeiK" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup></small> <br> <small> - Glen Coates is the VP of Product Shopify</small></p></blockquote>

<h2>When is a Product Manager (PM) Successful?</h2>
<p>When your product solves the problem better than everyone else so customers choose you.<small><sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3VRz18ntjQ" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup></small> <br> <small> - Paraphrased from Marty Cagan - Founder of Sillicon Valley Product Group
</small></p></p>

<h2>Product Manager Success Metrics</h2>

These metrics should trend in a positive direction when the PM is doing a good job:
<ul>
  <li>User adoption</li>
  <li>Business impact (i.e. revenue)</li>
  <li>Customer satisfaction</li>
</ul>

<h2>Product Manager Responsibilities</h2>

<p>PMs make sure <strong>the most import user problems</strong> are <strong>solved by cross-functional product teams</strong> in a way that <strong>works for the business</strong>.</p>

<p>This requires expert-level knowledge in:</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom:0">
  <li>The product</li>
  <li>The users</li>
  <li>The data</li>
  <li>The competitive landscape <small><sup><a href="https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1438004497775677444" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup></small></li>
</ul>

<p><br />Product managers also need to deeply understand the different parts of the business - how the product is marketed, sold, compliance issues, security issues, etc.</p>

<p>As described in this video PMs are responsible for more than just prioritizing a backlog. They are <em>creators</em> that work with the product team throughout the entire process. </p>

<h3>Product Team Responsibilities</h3>
Marty Cagan suggests that each person of the team is responsible for certain product "risks":

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>
            Product Risk
        </th>
        <th>
            Who's responsible?
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <strong>Valuable </strong> - do users want it?
        </td>
        <td>
            Product Manager
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <strong>Feasible</strong> - can we do it?
        </td>
        <td>
            Engineers
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <strong>Usable</strong> - can users figure it out?
        </td>
        <td>
            Designer
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <strong>Viable</strong> - does it make sense for the business?
        </td>
        <td>
            Product Manager
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Attributes of a good PM</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Immense user empathy</li>
    <li>Deep care/obsession</li>
    <li>Low ego</li>
    <li>High Agency</li>
    <li>Ownership Mindset</li>
    <li>Influential communication</li>
</ul>
<p>In my view, <em>high agency</em> individuals push through when faced with adverse conditions instead of blaming their circumstances.</p>
<p><em>Influencial communication</em> is important because it can be hard to get a team focused on the right problem to solve. I love Shreya's tweet:</p>
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A senior product manager‚Äôs singular value lies in galvanizing action around things that are<br><br>A) Not obvious but correct, or<br><br>B) Obvious but big &amp; scary<br><br>We tend romanticize A and it is indeed important, but in the real world, most products &amp; teams simply need a lot more of B.</p>&mdash; Shreyas Doshi (@shreyas) <a href="https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1432717456221605908?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 31, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Ultimately, the foundation of a successful company lies in its product, and the product manager is the linchpin of that success. Setting that person up for success is essential for the future of the business. </p>
<!-- 
<h2>Good product teams</h2>

According to Marty Cagan, good product teams have these traits: 
<ul>
<li>Given a problem to solve instead of a roadmap of prioritized features to crank out,</li>
<li>Outcome driven, not output driven</li>
<li>Designers build a great experience,</li>
<li>Engineers comes up with the ideas/solutions</li>
<li>Decisionmaking is pushed down to people who are in the trenches and have the context</li>
<li>Entire team steps up and cares about <em>what</em> you build not just <em>how</em></li>
<li>PM focuses on what's valuable and <em>viable</em> which are the hardest problems to solve</li>
<li>In good teams, products were conceived by true collaborations between engineers, designers and product managers. Not by some product manager declaring ‚Äúthese are the requirements, now go and design and build this.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
