          If your product is weak, everything gets harder and the company is at
          risk of failing. If your product is the best, everything gets easier
          and it becomes a force multiplier on success. Product management is a
          difficult and often misunderstood role. This article distills what I
          consider to be the core tenets of the product management role.

        <h2>Product Manager Success Metrics</h2>

        An increase in the these metrics indicate that the PM is doing a good
        job:
        <ul>
          <li>User adoption</li>
          <li>Business impact (i.e. revenue)</li>
          <li>Customer satisfaction</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- <h2>Responsibilities of the Product "Team"</h2> -->
        <!--         
        <p>
          Just because someone is responsible for the success one risk, doesn't
          mean they can't help out others on the team. This framework is to make
          ownership and accountability clear.
        </p> -->
        <h2>Product Manager Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>
          Within the broader product team, the group tasked with delivering a
          product, it's important to understand who's responsible for what. I
          like Marty Cagan's framework where each person is responsible for a
          different product "risk".
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th style="width: 60%">Product Risk</th>
            <th>Person Responsible</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Valuable </strong> - do users want it?</td>
            <td>Product Manager</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Feasible</strong> - can we do it?</td>
            <td>Engineers</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Usable</strong> - can users figure it out?</td>
            <td>Designer</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <strong>Viable</strong> - does it make sense for the business?
            </td>
            <td>Product Manager</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          A PM is responsible for ensuring a product is valuable (do users want
          it) and viable (does it make sense for the business). Here's how they
          go about that.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          PMs make sure
          <strong><u>the most important user problems</u></strong> are
          <strong><u>solved by product teams</u></strong> in a way that
          <strong><u>works for the business</u></strong
          >. This doesn't mean they just prioritize work. Good PMs are involved
          every step of the way and here's what it looks like:
        </p> -->

        <h3>1. Research</h3>
        <p>PMs need expert-level knowledge in the following:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 0">
          <li>The product</li>
          <li>The users</li>
          <li>The data</li>
          <li>
            The competitive landscape
            <!-- <small
              ><sup
                ><a
                  href="https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1438004497775677444"
                  target="_blank"
                  >[4]</a
                ></sup
              ></small
            > -->
          </li>
          <li>Intricacies of the business</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <br />The last bullet refers to how the product is marketed, sold,
          compliance issues, security issues, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          A PM must become a world expert in these areas and that requires a lot
          of time and an ongoing effort. It needs to be a key priority in the
          daily life of a PM. When this is done well, the PM brings key
          knowledge to the product team that allows everyone to make better
          decisions.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Problem Prioritization</h3>

        <p>
          Equiped with expert-level knowledge from their research, the PM's job
          is to get their team aligned on the product priorities.
        </p>

        <p style="background-color: yellow">Methods of prioritizeing</p>

        <img
          src="https://cdn.productboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/value-complexity-prioritization.png"
          style="width: 100%"
        />
        https://www.productboard.com/glossary/product-prioritization-frameworks/
        A value vs. Complexity Quadrant is a prioritization instrument in the
        form of a matrix. It is a simple 2 x 2 grid with ‚ÄúValue‚Äù plotted against
        ‚ÄúComplexity.‚Äù To make this framework work, the team has to quantify the
        value and complexity of each feature, update, fix, or another product
        initiative. ... If you can get more value with fewer efforts, that‚Äôs a
        feature you should prioritize.
        <!-- 
        <h3>Align the Team????</h3>

        <p>
          <em>Influencial communication</em> is important because it can be hard
          to get a team focused on the right problem to solve. The right problem
          is often not obvious to see and not easy to solve. It takes confidence
          and good communication skills to get the team aligned on the right
          problem:
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead of giving the team specific solutions to implement, it's much
          more effective to frame priorities as "problems". This results in
          better solutions that are easier to implement and teammates that are
          much more motivated.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sometimes problems can be not obvious or daunting. Shreyas Doshi,
          describes it well here:
        </p> -->

        <h3>3. Solution Refinement</h3>

        <p>This is the meat of the job.</p>

        <p>
          PM's don't just handoff priorities to the team and walk away. A good
          product manager is a creator that works closely with the team
          throughout the entire process. This includes driving the solution
          discovery process.

        also work side-by-side the enginerring team on the "how". -->

        <p>
          When your team comes up with a solution you need to test it with users
          as quickly and cheaply as possible. The PM must facilitate this
          process.

        <h3>4. Quality</h3>
        <p>
          Finally, my personal preference is if PMs are the last line of defence
          for product quality. The first line should be the engineers solving
          the problems to create a tight feedback loop.
        </p>
        <!-- 
<h2>Attributes of a good PM</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Immense user empathy</li>
    <li>Deep care/obsession</li>
    <li>Low ego</li>
    <li>High Agency</li>
    <li>Ownership Mindset</li>
    <li>Influential communication</li>
</ul>
<p>"Agency" is a term that often gets thrown around without a common definition. A high agency individual is simply someone who will <u>push through when faced with adverse conditions instead of blaming their circumstances</u>.</p> -->

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Ultimately, the foundation of a successful company lies in its
          product, and the product manager is the linchpin of that success.
          Setting that person up for success is essential for the future of the
          business.
        </p>
        <!-- 
<h2>Good product teams</h2>

According to Marty Cagan, good product teams have these traits: 
<ul>
<li>Given a problem to solve instead of a roadmap of prioritized features to crank out,</li>
<li>Outcome driven, not output driven</li>
<li>Designers build a great experience,</li>
<li>Engineers comes up with the ideas/solutions</li>
<li>Decisionmaking is pushed down to people who are in the trenches and have the context</li>
<li>Entire team steps up and cares about <em>what</em> you build not just <em>how</em></li>
<li>PM focuses on what's valuable and <em>viable</em> which are the hardest problems to solve</li>
