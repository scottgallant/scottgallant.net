            <h1 id="toc_0">How we helped our 3-year-old overcome constipation</h1>

            <p>Our 3-year-old was terribly constipated resulting in pretty severe pain. This made it difficult for our
                family to function because she would just try to comfort herself and never wanted to leave the house.
            </p>

            <p>Our doctor had prescribed Polyethylene glycol (PEG), a commonly used laxative powder that you mix in the
                patient&#39;s drinks each day. The brand we used was Restoralax. She had been on-and-off PEG for years
                and the problem was just getting worse. Our doctor explained there was likely a large mass of hard stool
                inside her body that she couldn&#39;t pass. In order to prevent it from getting worse, the laxative
                would liquify the new stool her body was producing so it could go around the large solid mass. The hard
                mass of stool never got passed and she had multiple liquid bowel movements every day. </p>

            <p>This was all happening just as she was transitioning out of diapers and using the potty. </p>

            <p>My wife started researching the long-term use of PEG and read many horror stories. We learned that PEG
                wasn&#39;t actually approved nor tested on children under the age of 17 even though it was commonly
                prescribed for kids of all ages. I was really surprised by this but the Restorolax label confirms this.
            </p>

            <h2 id="toc_1">Our solution</h2>

            <p>My wife read this book written by a parent whose child suffered from debiliating constipation and decided
                that we had to change our strategy.
                https://www.amazon.ca/Doctor-Didnt-About-Childhood-Constipation/dp/1079267565</p>

            <p>We followed many suggestions from the book but here are the key things that helped us overcome
                constipation: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Diet</li>
                <li>Glycerine suppository</li>
                <li>Switched from PEG to Magnesium citrate</li>
                <li>Potty confidence</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="toc_2">Diet</h2>

            <p>We made some small changes here. </p>

            <p><strong>Drink more water</strong>. We encouraged our daughter to drink more water, especially after
                eating dry foods (raisins, dried dates, etc). </p>

            <p><strong>Limit homemade sourdough bread</strong>. She was eating A LOT of this, and another family member
                said it resulted in constipation, so we just limited this as a precation. Not sure how big of a factor
                this was. </p>

            <p><strong>Tried to increase fiber</strong> For example, our daughter was into Sauerkraut (at the time), so
                she got that every day. We ate oatmeal for breakfast everyday to replace the bread. Our doctor said that
                bananas resulted in constipation, so we limited those. </p>

            <h2 id="toc_3">Glycerine suppository</h2>

            <p>Our daughter was really reluctant to use a suppository. A doctor at the hospital used one with her and it
                helped her pass a large stool mass once. With a lot of convincing she let us do this. Since we
                didn&#39;t want to force her to do this, we spent a lot of time trying to convince her that this would
                help. And if I recall correctly, some days we lost the battle and some days she was cooperative.
                Ultimately, this helped her pass some very large hard stools that were blocking her up 2 or 3 times.
            </p>

            <h2 id="toc_4">Switched from PEG to Magnesium Sulfate</h2>

            <p>We stopped giving her Restoralax (PEG) and started mixing powered magnesium citrate each day. We followed
                the does in the book linked to above, but you should talk to your doctor if you’re considering this. We
                continued giving her magnesium sulfate for a… few months ???
                [ Theresa to add notes here? ]</p>

            <h2 id="toc_5">Potty Confidence</h2>

            <p>This was one of the most important factors, IMO. Our daughter was terrified of the potty because she
                associated it with painful poops. That held her back from having regular bowel movements. Ultimately, we
                wanted her to have regular potty time each day. I first started by trying to get her to sit on the potty
                for 10 seconds. I would count with my fingers and when we got to ten, she got off the potty and we would
                celebrate (possibly with a reward/treat). She was just building confidence without having a bowel
                movement. When her mom came in the room I would say &quot;Guess what? She sat on the potty for 10
                SECONDS!&quot; in front of our daughter to help her feel proud. We eventually started doing 20 seconds,
                then 60 seconds, and so on. We would read books, play with toys, give her rewards, and eventually the
                potty wasn&#39;t scary anymore. She started sitting on the potty for 10 mins or so each morning where
                she would read books, eat some frozen fruit, and have a bowel movement. If she didn’t have a bowel
                movement in the morning, we often would try again later in the day. </p>

            <h2 id="toc_6">Conclusion</h2>

            <p>Eventually, she overcame this problem but we had to keep on top of it. </p>
