            <h1 id="toc_0">How we helped our 3-year-old overcome constipation</h1>

            <p>Our 3-year-old was constipated on and off for more than a year. At times it resulted in a lot of pain and
                discomfort. It was heartbreaking to witness and made it difficult for our family to function. </p>

            <p>Our doctor had prescribed Polyethylene glycol (PEG), a commonly used laxative powder that you mix in the
                child’s drink each day. The brand we used was Restoralax. Our child had been on-and-off PEG for years
                and the problem was just getting worse. Our doctor explained there was likely a large mass of hard stool
                inside our kiddo’s body that was causing the blockage. In order to prevent it from getting worse, the
                laxative
                would liquefy the new stool that the body was producing so it could go around the large solid mass. The
                hard mass of stool never got passed and our child experienced multiple liquid bowel movements every day.
            </p>

            <p>This was all happening just as we were transitioning out of diapers and using the potty. </p>

            <p>My wife started researching the long-term use of PEG and read many horror stories. We learned that PEG
                wasn&#39;t actually approved nor tested on children under the age of 17 even though it was commonly
                prescribed for young kids.</p>

            <h2 id="toc_1">Our solution</h2>

            <p>My wife read <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Doctor-Didnt-About-Childhood-Constipation/dp/1079267565">this
                    book</a> written by a parent whose child suffered from debilitating constipation and she decided
                that we had to change our strategy. </p>

            <p>We followed many suggestions from the book but here are the key things that helped us overcome
                constipation: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Diet</li>
                <li>Glycerine suppository</li>
                <li>Switched from PEG to Magnesium citrate</li>
                <li>Potty confidence</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="toc_2">Diet</h2>

            <p>We made the following diet changes.</p>

            <p><strong>Drink more water</strong>. We encouraged our child to drink more water, especially after eating
                dry foods (raisins, dried dates, etc). </p>

            <p><strong>Limit homemade sourdough bread</strong>. Our child was eating A LOT of this, and another family
                member said that they experienced constipation after eating this bread, so we just limited this as a
                precaution. Not sure how big of a factor this was. </p>

            <p><strong>Increase fiber</strong>. Our child was into Sauerkraut (at the time), so we ensured that was
                available every day. We ate oatmeal for breakfast every day to replace sourdough bread. Our doctor said
                that bananas resulted in constipation, so we limited those. </p>

            <h2 id="toc_3">Glycerine suppository</h2>

            <p>Our child was really reluctant to use a suppository. We didn&#39;t want to force them to do this, so we
                put a lot of effort into explaining it to them to convince our child that this would help. If I recall
                correctly, some days we lost the battle and had to forgo the suppository, but we had a few successes
                too. Ultimately, this helped our child pass some very large, hard stools that caused constipation. </p>

            <h2 id="toc_4">Switched from PEG to Magnesium Citrate</h2>

            <p>We stopped giving our child Restoralax (PEG) and started mixing powdered magnesium citrate every day. We
                followed the does in the book linked above, but you should talk to your doctor if you’re considering
                this. We continued using magnesium citrate for a couple of months (if I recall correctly).</p>

            <h2 id="toc_5">Potty Confidence</h2>

            <p>This was one of the most important factors. Our child was terrified of the potty because they associated
                it with painful poops. That held us back from regular bowel movements. Ultimately, we wanted regular
                potty time each day. I first started by trying to get our kiddo to sit on the potty for 10 seconds. I
                would count with my fingers and when we got to ten, we would celebrate (possibly with a reward/treat).
                We were just building confidence on the potty without having a bowel movement. When mom came in the room
                I would say &quot;Guess what? We sat on the potty for 10 SECONDS!&quot; to our child feel proud. We
                eventually started doing 20 seconds, then 60 seconds, and so on. We would read books, play with toys,
                give rewards, and the potty wasn&#39;t scary anymore. Eventually, poop started to come during these
                sessions. It was scary at first but we overcame it and continued to celebrate. Our child started sitting
                on the potty for 10 mins or so each morning looking at search-and-find books, eating frozen fruit, and
                having a bowel movement. If we didn’t have a bowel movement in the morning, we often would try again
                later in the day. This is a ritual we still keep up with today (almost 2 years later). </p>

            <h2 id="toc_6">Conclusion</h2>

            <p>Our child overcame constipation, got off of PEG for good, and now treats potty time as a fun time. Our
                doctor said that a child’s bowel can become oversized due to a large stool blockage and it would take
                time to shrink back to size, so we continued using magnesium citrate for 30 days after we were cleared
                up. Severe constipation can be a scary thing but I’m really happy to say that’s behind us now and I’m
                confident you will get there too.</p>
